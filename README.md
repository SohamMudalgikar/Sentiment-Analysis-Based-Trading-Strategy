# Sentiment-Analysis-Based-Trading-Strategy

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Sentiment-Based Trading Strategy** project! This initiative merges the realms of sentiment analysis and financial trading to create a data-driven strategy aimed at enhancing investment decisions. By analyzing public sentiment from Twitter and integrating it with historical stock data, this project generates actionable buy and sell signals intended to improve trading accuracy and profitability.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a trading strategy that leverages social media sentiment to inform and optimize trading decisions. By understanding the market sentiment surrounding specific stocks, the strategy aims to anticipate price movements and execute trades that align with prevailing trends, thereby increasing the potential for profitable outcomes.

### Strategy

The trading strategy is constructed by combining sentiment analysis with traditional technical indicators. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the strategy operates:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - **Stock Data**: Historical stock price data is retrieved using the Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`). This includes daily closing prices, which are essential for calculating technical indicators like moving averages.
   - **Social Media Data**: Tweets mentioning the target stock ticker are fetched using the Twitter API via the `Tweepy` library. These tweets provide real-time sentiment data from the public.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Each collected tweet is analyzed using the `TextBlob` library to determine its sentiment polarity, which ranges from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive).
   - The sentiment scores of all tweets within a specific timeframe (e.g., daily) are aggregated to compute an average sentiment score. This score reflects the overall public sentiment towards the stock on that day.

3. **Technical Indicators**:
   - **Moving Averages**: Two moving averages are calculated:
     - **50-Day Moving Average (MA50)**: Represents the average closing price over the past 50 days.
     - **200-Day Moving Average (MA200)**: Represents the average closing price over the past 200 days.
   - These moving averages help identify long-term and short-term trends in the stock's price movement.

4. **Signal Generation**:
   - **Buy Signal**:
     - Triggered when the MA50 crosses above the MA200, indicating a bullish trend.
     - The average sentiment score for the day is positive, suggesting favorable public sentiment.
   - **Sell Signal**:
     - Triggered when the MA50 crosses below the MA200, indicating a bearish trend.
     - The average sentiment score for the day is negative, suggesting unfavorable public sentiment.
   - These signals aim to capitalize on both technical trends and market sentiment to make more informed trading decisions.

5. **Visualization**:
   - The strategy includes comprehensive visualizations that plot stock prices, moving averages, sentiment scores, and trading signals.
   - These visual tools aid in interpreting the data and understanding the rationale behind each trading signal.

### How Sentiment Analysis is Integrated

Sentiment analysis serves as a supplementary layer to traditional technical analysis, providing additional context to trading signals. Here's how the integration enhances the strategy:

- **Enhancing Trend Confirmation**: While moving averages indicate potential trend changes, sentiment analysis verifies these trends with real-time public opinion. A buy signal supported by positive sentiment is more robust than one based solely on technical indicators.
  
- **Filtering False Signals**: Sentiment analysis helps filter out false trading signals. For instance, if technical indicators suggest a buy, but the sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, it may be prudent to withhold the buy action.
  
- **Capturing Market Psychology**: Sentiment analysis captures the collective psychology of market participants, which can be a leading indicator of price movements. By incorporating this, the strategy aligns more closely with market behavior.

## Features
